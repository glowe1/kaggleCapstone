## Index Strategy

**High Priority Indexes (Already Created):**
- User lookups: email, role, status
- Resident searches: branch_id, status, last_name
- Medication tracking: resident_medication_id, administration_time
- Vital monitoring: resident_id + date, status
- Appointments: resident_id + date, status
- Behavior tracking: resident_id + date, behavior_id
- Sleep records: resident_id + date
- Incidents: status + priority, raised_by
- Leave requests: staff_id + status, date range

**Additional Indexes to Consider:**
- Full-text search on resident names
- Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Partial indexes for active records only

---

## Data Integrity Notes

1. **Soft Deletes** - Users, Residents, Branches, Facilities
2. **Cascade Deletes** - All child records when parent is deleted
3. **Set NULL** - Incidents when resident is deleted
4. **Audit Logging** - All critical operations logged
5. **Timestamps** - All tables have created_at and updated_at

---

## Security Considerations

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- API tokens for mobile/external access
- Audit logs track all changes
- Soft deletes preserve historical data
- Foreign keys prevent orphaned records
- Role-based access control built-in
